# MongoNews

Welcome to the Mongo News app! This app helps you take notes on articles from one of the top tech news sites around, Smashing Magazine. This app has scraped their newest articles page and displays those stories. Furthermore, you can create notes on any of the stories that you can come back to at any time. 

This app runs with the help of Mongo DB. Each of the news stories and notes are saved into their own collections on Mongo DB. 

In order to use this app, just click on any of the articles you wish to make notes on. When you click on a story, a note box will appear on the right side of the screen. Just give your note a title and body, and then save it. This note will be saved, so you can come back at any time and view or edit your notes.
